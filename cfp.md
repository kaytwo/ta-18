# Call for Papers

Cybercrime is perpetrated in order to maximize yield in some way for an
attacker: they may want to maximize economic gain, data stolen, or simply
damage to their adversary. At the same time, these actions cause damage both to
the intended targets as well as collateral damage to bystanders and the
Internet ecosystem as a whole. Being able to assess the impact of attacks on
the direct and indirect victims enables efforts that allocate resources and
prioritize defenses, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the most
damaging attacks, and how those attacks cause their damage to victims.

These types of impacts can happen either as part of a single event, or as part
of an ongoing campaign: understanding how targeted, sophisticated, or otherwise
low-volume attacks can evade detection, as well as the amount of damage these
attacks cause over time, can better provide insights into finding ways to
prevent or mitigate the damage that they potentially cause.


Understanding how these attacks cause damage to the user from the perspective
of the user is important as well: novel methods for mitigating or even
obviating the damage to users could nullify these attacks, which would likely
also have the side effect of making them less lucrative to attackers.


## Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:

* User and Offender focused experiments
* Prediction of targeted attacks
* Delivery channels
* Measuring yield
* Understanding what data is most valuable to attackers
* Understanding which attacks are most damaging to users
* Understanding how the impact of attacks can be quantified at scale
* New countermeasures
* Identification of trends
* Social engineering methods
* Business email compromise / CEO Fraud
* Effective awareness training methods against targeted attacks

## Important dates

* Papers due Tuesday, December 12
* Final decisions sent Monday, January 22
* Camera readies due Monday, February 5
* Workshop Friday, March 2

## Program Chair

Chris Kanich, UIC

## Program Committee

* Ana Ferreira, University of Porto
* Markus Jakobsson, Agari
* David Maimon, UMD
* Damon McCoy, NYU
* Nick Nickiforakis, Stony Brook University
* Jason Polakis, UIC
* Hossein Siadati, NYU

## Submission

Submissions are sought in the following categories: 
* regular papers (15 pages LNCS format excluding references and appendices)
* short papers (8 pages LNCS format in total)

The regular and short paper submissions must be anonymous, with no author
names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Papers must be
formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in
other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically
according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.
For each accepted paper the workshop requires at least one registration at the
general or academic rate. Authors may only submit work that does not
substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been
accepted for publication to a conference/workshop with proceedings or a
journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it
as such. In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications at
<ckanich@uic.edu>. Paper submissions should be uploaded through the conference
[submission website](https://fc18ta.hotcrp.com/).

## Regular Research Papers

Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific
contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review.
Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be
published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding
references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed
proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices,
so the full papers should be intelligible without them. Regular papers must be
anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious
references.

## Short Papers

Short papers are also subject to peer review, however, the intention is to
encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications and
corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus
on novelty and potential for sparking participants’ interest and future
research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard
LNCS format in total. The paper title for short papers should necessarily
include the text “Short Paper:” Accepted submissions will be included in the
conference proceedings. Short papers must be also anonymous with no author
names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references.
