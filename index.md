# Overview

Cybercrime is perpetrated in order to maximize yield in some way for an attacker: they may want to maximize economic gain, data stolen, or simply damage to their adversary. At the same time, these actions cause damage both to the intended targets as well as collateral damage to bystanders and the Internet ecosystem as a whole. Being able to assess the impact of attacks on the direct and indirect victims enables efforts that allocate resources and prioritize defenses, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the most damaging attacks, and how those attacks cause their damage to victims.
